            <p class="mx-2 mb-2">The next step in artificial intelligence (AI) will be achieved in 2025. Starting with
                the
                AlexNet in 2012, which was the first big leap in AI technology, a new roadmap for AI emerged. After
                AlexNet the next step was perception AI (speech recognition, deep recommender systems and medical
                imaging). The current AI landscape is shaped by generative AI (digital marketing and content creation).
                The next step, starting in 2025, is agentic AI (coding assistance, customer service, patient
                care).<sup><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="mx-2">Unlike typical AI systems, agentic AI performs tasks independently, making decisions and
                carrying out activities without ongoing supervision and user inputs. This progress has the potential to
                revolutionise businesses, workplaces, and everyday life, but it also poses serious concerns about
                ethics, safety, and human oversight.<sup><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/agentic-ai"
                        target="_blank">[2]</a></sup></p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold m-2">What is Agentic AI?</h3>
            <p class="mx-2 mb-2">Agentic AI is capable of independent action, it can analyse data, make decisions and
                execute
                tasks across many topics. These AI systems can help in daily life or the workplace. For example, it can
                troubleshoot IT issues, optimise workflows, manage supply chains, act as personal assistants, summarise
                news or manage household devices.</p>
            <p class="mx-2">Agentic AI can operate without human input. This autonomy is enabled by advances in machine
                learning models, multimodal capabilities (text, pictures, and audio processing), and improved reasoning
                ability.<sup><a href="https://software-aspekte.de/en/blog/ai-trends/" target="_blank">[3]</a>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold m-2">Applications Across Industries</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal mx-8">
                <li class="mb-2">Workplace Transformation: Agentic AI is intended to change productivity by automating
                    repetitive
                    and difficult jobs. Tools such as Microsoft Copilot Studio currently allow non-technical people to
                    create custom AI agents that are suited to specific requirements.<sup><a
                            href="https://software-aspekte.de/en/blog/ai-trends/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup></li>
                <li class="mb-2">Healthcare: Autonomous agents could monitor patients in real-time or assist in
                    diagnostics by
                    analysing medical data more efficiently than human practitioners.<sup><a

                        <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/future-of-ai" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup></li>
                <li>Logistics and Manufacturing: Smart logistics systems powered by agentic AI can predict inventory
                    needs, automate warehouse operations, and streamline supply chains.<sup><a
                            href="https://software-aspekte.de/en/blog/ai-trends/" target="_blank">[3]</a>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold m-2">Ethical Challenges and Oversight</h3>
            <p class="mx-2 mb-2">While agentic AI offers huge potential, it also poses problems. Autonomous
                decision-making
                can lead to unintended behaviour if not well controlled. For example:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc mx-8">
                <li class="mb-2">Bias in Decision-Making: Inadequate training data and protections can perpetuate or
                    intensify biases
                    in AI decision-making.<sup><a
                            href="https://www.restack.io/p/ai-development-trends-predictions-answer-must-read-ai-research-2025"
                            target="_blank">[6]</a></sup></li>
                <li class="mb-2">Loss of Human Oversight: Autonomous systems pose a difficulty for accountability.
                    Finding a balance
                    between autonomy and human control will be critical.<sup>
                        <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-cee/2025/01/08/6-ai-trends-youll-see-more-of-in-2025/"
                            target="_blank">[4]</a>

                            target="_blank">[5]</a>
                    </sup></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mx-2">Governments and organisations are starting to address these concerns. Regulatory frameworks
                are being
                developed to ensure responsible use of agentic AI while fostering innovation.<sup><a
                        href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/january/isambard-ai-govt-action-plan.html"

            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold m-2">Looking Ahead</h3>
            <p class="mx-2 mb-2">Agentic AI is a big advancement in AI. Automating complicated operations and improving
                decision-making processes can change industries and improve the daily life. However, its success will be
                contingent on overcoming ethical concerns and retaining strong human oversight.
            </p>
            <p class="mx-2">To maximise the benefits and minimise the drawbacks of agentic AI, it is important to
                coordinate this future with politicians, researchers and industry leaders.
